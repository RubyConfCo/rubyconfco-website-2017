            1. Taxis - You will see blue and white taxis located outside the doors when you exit the airport. Although all taxis in Medellin use taxi-meters, the ride to/from the airport is fixed at $60.000COP or a bit more depending on which part of the city your are going to. However, just to be on the safe side, make sure to ask the taxi driver the price before leaving the airport.
            %br
            %br
            2. Colectivos (small buses) - These are shared taxis or mini-buses also located just outside when you exit. Colectivos cost $15.000 COP per person from the airport to El Poblado.
            %br
            %br
            %b Note:
            Colectivos will NOT drop you off directly at your destination. Instead they will drop you in front of San Diego Mall. We suggest taking a taxi from this point to your destination.

            %b 1. Taxi -
            The fastest and most convenient way is to take a taxi. These taxis are yellow and legally must charge you based on the reading on the taxi meter, so there is no need to negotiate your fare. We recommend that you get a cab using any of the available apps:
