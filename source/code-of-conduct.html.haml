          %h2.accordion__header--title 1. Purpose
        .accordion__body
          %p A primary goal of RubyConf Colombia is to be inclusive to the largest number of attendees, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

          %p This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our conference, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

          %p We invite all those who participate in RubyConf Colombia to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

          %h2.accordion__header--title 2. Open Source Citizenship
        .accordion__body
          %p A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on the conference.

          %p Conferences mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

          %p If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our conference is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

        .accordion__body
          %p Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our conference, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of the conference. RubyConf Colombia venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

          %p Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

          %h2.accordion__header--title 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
        .accordion__body
          %p Unacceptable behavior from any conference participant, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

          %p Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

          %p If a conference participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the conferences organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

        .accordion__header
          %h2.accordion__header--title 6. If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
        .accordion__body
          %p If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible.
          
          %p Email: organizers@rubyconf.co

          %p Additionally, conference organizers are available to help conference participants engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

        .accordion__header
          %h2.accordion__header--title 7. Addressing Grievances
        .accordion__body
          %p These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct in our communication channels, associated meetups, conferences, study groups y virtual events.

          %ul
            %li Remarks that violate the Code of Conduct standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
            %li Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
            %li Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
            %li If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
            %li If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
            %li Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
            %li If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, <strong>in private</strong>. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
            %li Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
            
          %p In the RubyConf Colombia we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

          %p And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow participants comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
